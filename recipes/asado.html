    <h3>A typical Argentinan asado</h3>
    <p>The fastest way to make enemies in Argentina is to compare the asado to a barbecue. It's the same, right?<br>
        No, the locals will tell you, through gritted teeth, it is not the same. Your gas-fuelled blow-torching<br>
        of conveyor-belt beef patties has nothing in common with our sacred asado. They've got a point. Asado <br>
        is cooking in its purest form - just fire, grill and meat - so it's important that you get it right.<br>
        Otherwise, you've got yourself a barbecue.<br>

        <li>Offal</li>
        <li>Sweetbreads</li>

        <li>Onion</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Start your fire. Make a stack of dry wood sitting on top of a heap of lump charcoal under the left-hand side<br>
            of your parrilla, a cast-iron grill which can be adjusted to different heights.<br>

        </li><br>
        <li> If he (always he) is having problems getting his fire to light, an Argentine will throw on a few pine cones<br>
            - not briquettes, which taint the meat (and severely damage your rep as an asador).</li><br>
        <li> Once the grill has heated up, give it a vigorous clean with newspaper to remove all yesterday's carbonised<br>
            cow and arm yourself with the tools of the asador - the shovel and rake - for moving embers around.</li><br>
        <li> When the flames and smoke of your initial fire have relented, you will have a pile of smouldering charcoal<br>
            to the left of your grill, from which you rake across glowing embers to sit under the right.<br>

        </li><br>
        <li>Lower the grill to 15cm above the smouldering bed of coals. Waiting in the wings are your cuts of meat, very<br>
            specific to the asado, so introduce the biggest cuts first, starting with the tira de asado (short rib).
        </li><br>
        <li>Allow 500g of meat per person. It sounds crazy, but the average Argentinean eats around 60kg of meat a year<br>
            and half a kilo a head works out about right.</li><br>
        <li>Keep the hottest coals aside to avoid fat dripping and flares of smoke, which spoil the flavour of the meat.<br>
            Vacio (flank) and entraña (skirt) are two other flavoursome cuts, which respond beautifully to asado<br>
            cooking.<br>

        </li><br>
        <li>It's impossible to overcook beef in Argentina, as the locals like it medium to well done. If the meat is<br>
            good, they say, this is the best way to cook it: low and slow.<br>

        </li><br>
        <li>The steady cooking process - fiddling is frowned upon - will give you plenty of time for the social element<br>
            of the asado, conducted over a glass of Malbec and a few picadas (cheese/ham/salami/olives on sticks).<br>
        </li><br>
        <li>Next onto the parrilla are the achuras (offal). The entry-level offal is mollejas [moh-shay-has],<br>
            sweetbreads that are grilled to smokey crispness and served with a squeeze of lemon. Often these are the<br>
            only achuras served, but they can also be accompanied by chinchulines [chin-choo-leen-ez] - intestines - and riñones<br>
            [rin-yon-ez] - kidneys.<br>

        </li><br>
        <li>Now it's the turn of the chorizo, morcilla (blood sausage) and provoleta (discs provolone cheese) - last in,<br>
            first onto plates.</li><br>
        <li> Once all three are crisp on the outside and oozing within, the locals usually cut them into small pieces<br>
            and serve them with slices of baguette, spread onto or sandwiched.</li><br>
        <li>Once the meat is ready, your team of sous-chefs should have finished making your salads. Of course, a true<br>
            Argentino doesn't need a side of salad to justify his meat consumption (this is, after all, the country<br>
            where vegetarians are served chicken) though an ensalada criolla - tomato, lettuce and onion dressed with<br>
            oil and white wine vinegar - cuts through the richness of the meat perfectly.<br>

        </li><br>
        <li> Chimichurri, surprisingly, isn't a fixture on Argentinean tables. And if it is, it's certainly not glowing<br>
            with fresh herbs - it's based largely on dried oregano. You're likely to find (more) salt on the dinner<br>
            table, as well as some tangy salsa criolla, a fresh condiment made from red peppers, tomato, onion, parsley, oil and<br>
            vinegar.<br>

        </li><br>
        <li>If you've done this right, you should be sitting down to a table groaning with meat and Malbec round about<br>
            midnight. Serve the meat in the order that it's ready.<br>

        </li><br>
        <li> Enjoy 'un aplauso para el asador' when you sit down. It's no reflection on the quality of your output -<br>
            applause is granted whatever the standard of the cooking - but by this point, you've earned it.</li><br>
    </ol>
